Question: I have this question: how far is mars, and you have this data to help you: None to generate a response to that question. Please answer with an alternative data with different wording and don't forget what you chatted earlier. Here's the memory chat:

Response: On average, Mars is about 225 million kilometers (140 million miles) away from Earth. But this distance can range from about 54.6 million kilometers (33.9 million miles) at the closest approach, which we call opposition, to about 401 million kilometers (249 million miles) when the two planets are on opposite sides of the sun
