Response: It's often called Earth's sister planet because it's similar in size and composition. Venus is the second planet from the Sun, located between Mercury and Earth. It has a thick atmosphere primarily made up of carbon dioxide, which traps heat and makes Venus the hottest planet in our solar system.

Did you know that Venus has a runaway greenhouse effect? This means that the heat from the Sun gets trapped in the atmosphere, causing the planet's surface

Venus is often referred to as Earth's "twin" due to its similar size and composition. It is the second planet from the Sun and is known for its thick atmosphere, which consists mainly of carbon dioxide with traces of sulfuric acid. In fact, Venus has a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet
