Response: Mars is often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance, which is caused by iron oxide (or rust) on its surface. This fourth planet from the Sun has the tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and a huge canyon called Valles Marineris. Mars has a thin atmosphere and signs of ancient floods, but today its water is mostly frozen in polar ice caps. Robots like the Perseverance rover are exploring Mars right now to uncover more of
